\begin{document}

We first include an image from the current repos:

first inline: \mhgraphics{kwarc} and then centered

\cmhgraphics{kwarc}


And then we give an explicit repos (this is the same as  the current one, but {\LaTeX}
doesn't know)

\mhgraphics[mhrepos=omdoc/mathhub]{kwarc} 
\end{document}
