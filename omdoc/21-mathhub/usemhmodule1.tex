We first include from the current repos
\usemhmodule{BAR} 

And then we give an explicit path (this is the same as  the current one, but {\LaTeX}
doesn't know)
\usemhmodule[path=BAR]{BAR} 

And then we also give an explicit repos (this is the same as  the current one, but {\LaTeX}
doesn't know)

\usemhmodule[mhrepos=omdoc/mathhub,path=BAR]{BAR}

and the same with just the dir attribute. 

\usemhmodule[dir=.]{FOO}
