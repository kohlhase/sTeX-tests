# sTeX-tests: Systematic Tests for sTeX

This repository will be integrated into the [sTeX](https://github.com/sLaTeX/sTeX) and [LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX](https://github.com/sLaTeX/LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX] repositories. 

It contains tests organized by
[sTeX package/class](https://github.com/sLaTeX/sTeX/tree/master/sty/). There are two test
targets:

* `omdoc` for OMDoc generated and
* `html` for sTeX in HTML (later).
